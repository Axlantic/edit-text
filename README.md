edit-text is a collaborative rich text editor, written in Rust with a frontend in WebAssembly.

**This is very early software. ðŸ‘¶**

## Running

You'll need `cargo-script` to run the build tool and `diesel-cli` for the Sqlite file:

```
cargo install cargo-script
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

Install the WebAssembly target:

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

To test out the text editor live, first setup the db and compile the wasm bundle, then you can run the server:

```
diesel setup
./x.rs wasm-build
./x.rs server
```

Navigate to <localhost:8000> and start editing!

## Local client proxy in Rust (no WASM)

Start the sync server in one terminal with this switch:

```
./x.rs server --client-proxy
```

In another terminal, run the client proxy:

```
./x.rs client-proxy
```

You will see any failures appear in the client-proxy code that would appear in the browser console when in WASM mode.

## Compiling the frontend

The frontend (TypeScript) code is tracked using git, but you can also develop on it yourself. Make sure you have Node installed first, then:

```
npm i --prefix ./mercutio-frontend
./x.rs frontend-watch
```

To watch and continuously build all frontend code. Note that the .wasm bundle isn't inlined into the bundle with webpack, but loaded asynchronously.
